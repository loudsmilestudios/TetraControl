## Building

This project is currently only targeting Linux, so it is recommended development is done a [VSCode Development Container](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).

Once in a properly configured Linux environment, you can simply run: `make full-build`

After the inital build, you can run `make build` to just run `go build`
